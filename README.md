# ClimateHeroes

**Inspiration**
As a passionate environmentalist, I've always been concerned about the growing issue of climate change (I actually have a Geography exam on Climate Change tomorrow). The inspiration for ClimateHeroes came from the idea that an engaging and enjoyable game could not only entertain players but also educate them on the importance of clean energy and the actions they can take to combat climate change, ultimately empowering them to make a difference.

**What it does**
ClimateHeroes is a tower defence strategy game where the player deploys eco-elemental heroes - Wind, Solar, and Hydro - to battle against humans, the climate culprits and protect the environment. The game not only entertains players but also integrates environmental facts and actionable tips on climate change prevention. By playing ClimateHeroes, players will learn about climate change, its consequences, and how they can contribute to a more sustainable future. The game emphasizes specific principles, such as utilizing three sustainable resources to protect the Earth, and highlighting that humans are the primary contributors to climate change!

**How to Play**
The game starts with the player having 50 energy points. In order to purchase characters, players can toggle one of the buttons at the top of the screen. Once purchased, players can place their eco-elemental heroes on the game board by clicking down. The game features various eco-elemental heroes, such as Sunray, Breezy Beast, and Wind Weaver. Sunray generates solar energy that players can spend, Breezy Beast attacks enemies by launching hydro projectiles, and Wind Weaver produces winds that push enemies back. However, enemies can only be affected by Wind Weaver's winds twice. Players must be strategic with their energy usage. When they run out of energy, a prompt saying "Not enough energy" pops up. Players can regain energy by eliminating enemies; when a character is defeated, players gain 10 energy points and are presented with fun facts about climate change. In ClimateHeroes, humans are the adversaries as they are responsible for climate change. Players assume the role of heroes on the opposing side, utilizing renewable energy sources to combat their opponents. Enemies in the game have different speeds, depending on their character type. The game concludes when an enemy character reaches the end of the player's screen. ClimateHeroes not only offers hours of entertainment but also raises awareness about environmental issues and inspires players to take action against climate change.

**How we built it**
I built ClimateHeroes using the Unity 3D Engine and the C# programming language. I combined my creativity, technical expertise, and passion for the environment to design engaging characters representing wind, solar, and hydro energy. I developed a challenging strategy game where players strategically place these heroes to defeat climate culprits. Throughout the development process, I focused on integrating environmental facts and tips to ensure an educational aspect within the game. All Unity assets used in the project were sourced from the Unity Asset Store.

**Challenges we ran into**
One of the main challenges I faced was finding the right balance between entertainment and education. I wanted to create a game that would captivate players while also conveying the crucial message about climate change. Another challenge was dealing with bugs in the code and finding the best way to optimize the game for a smooth player experience. It took time and perseverance to overcome these challenges and come up with a game that is both enjoyable and educational.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
I am proud of creating a game that not only entertains but also has the potential to inspire change. Successfully integrating environmental education into an engaging gaming experience, ClimateHeroes can help raise awareness about climate change and encourage players to take meaningful steps towards a more sustainable future. Additionally, overcoming the technical challenges and finding the right balance between entertainment and education has been a fulfilling accomplishment.

**What we learned**
During the development of ClimateHeroes, I learned about the power of wind, solar, and hydro energy and how these alternatives can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I also gained valuable insights into game design, balancing gameplay, and effectively conveying an important message through an interactive medium. Furthermore, working with Unity 3D and C# allowed me to improve my skills in game development and programming.

**What's next for ClimateHeroes**
Moving forward, I plan to expand ClimateHeroes with new levels, characters, and challenges to keep players engaged and motivated to learn more about climate change. I also aim to include more actionable tips on reducing individual carbon footprints, promoting sustainable lifestyles, and inspiring players to make a difference in their communities. Additionally, I hope to collaborate with environmental organizations and experts to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is provided within the game. My ultimate goal is to bring ClimateHeroes to various platforms, making it accessible to a wider audience and inspiring more people to take action in the fight against climate change.
